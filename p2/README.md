# Project 2 for e15

Dear Professor buck,

I really had some bold ideas for this project but found myself programming down to the wire. My original idea was to create a menu that would add up any extra toppings and to return a price depending on what was ordered. After hours of being lost, I had to settle for the end result. As always, being lost helped me in the long run. I found many new bugs to add to my bug collection of experience. For example, I had no idea that to write the word null, do not surround it with quotes. I kept doing a var dump and would see my variable was null, but little did I realize that it was a string outputting the word null. Hours of fun that one was. But I tell ya, there is nothing like the feeling when you figure it out. Like beating the boss level of a video game. For this assignment there was many of these moments. 

Of course, many bits of knowledge still remain a mystery to me, like how to bypass bootstrap.css and add my own elements. Also, how to validate a phone number. I will try to ask in the forum in the future, but I was running short on time. I will say I do love the way the Laravel framework returns errors. I was doing a project for another class in node.js with javascript and it was not as user friendly.

Most of my projects in your course I have relied heavily on your notes and lectures as a template. This time around I tried to see how far I could swim. I thought I would start out with two controllers, the main one and my page controller. I am not sure what I was doing wrong but I kept breaking my code. By the last two days of the extended deadline I had to swim back to safety and rework my code.

I wanted to include a navigation page with the path leading to “/order” and have the customer order from there, but I kept coming across errors so I left the order form on my main page. I know it had something to do with the way I was redirecting my page or the session data but I could not figure it out. The parts of my code that I did on my own look a bit rickety and I value any feedback you can provide. 

Thank you,
Britney Sandau
